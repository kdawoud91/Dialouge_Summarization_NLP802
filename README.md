# Dialouge_Summarization_NLP802

#Overview

This repository contains resources and code for dialogue summarization, showcasing two distinct approaches: a Zero-shot approach and a Fine-tuning approach. These methods are designed to summarize dialogues effectively, catering to different scenarios and use cases in natural language processing.
#Contents

zero_shot_summarization.py: This script implements the Zero-shot learning approach for dialogue summarization. It is designed to work with minimal training data and can be applied to dialogues it hasn't seen during training.

fine_tuning_summarization.py: This file contains code for the Fine-tuning approach. It is intended for scenarios where more tailored summarization is required, leveraging additional training data to fine-tune the summarization model.
